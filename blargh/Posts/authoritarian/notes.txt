So, the big three:
* end wars and general global imperialism (and thus shrink military budget)
* modernize american healthcare
* fight climate change by reducing CO2 emission

other things that would be good
* legalize weed. Expunge silly non-violent weed convictions
* pump up the minimum wage, index it to inflation
* better democratic practices (eliminate gerrymandering, eliminate the Electoral College, go to vote-by-mail)
* Govt out of medical choices (abortion and suicide are not the govt buisness)
* elimiate the penny (and probably nickel)
* modernize tax collection (IRS should send me a postcard telling me how much I owe)
* Cancel student debt.
