xkcd did some cool plots looking at chess and NBA player rankings over time.  Now, this should be super easy to do for tennis since the rankings are published!

Cool things to note:
* Agassi rose to #1 from being out of the top 10 THREE TIMES
* Lleyton Hewitt has had an amazingly long post-number 1 career
* Nadal SHOT up to the #2 spot, and then was just parked behind Fed for a looong time.
* Sampras and Edberg both managed to stop playing ranked #14. 
* Sampras was the only one to finish on a win (The US Open).
* The right hand side looks kind of clean, but that's just a selection effect since we don't know who will be #1 in the future.  We've had 11 dominant players in the last 37 years, so there should be a new dominant player coming up the rankings every ~3-4 years, and the last was Djokovic in 2007.
