   I'm working on making a model for the background sky brightness on Cerro Pachon. This model will be used to help optimize the LSST scheduler.  This will include emission from the atmosphere, scattered moon light, and solar twilight.

    I've been working on a project to study Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies.  These are bizarre systems that look like normal spirals, but are actually an order of magnitude larger in diameter.  There have been some creative formation theories proposed for these, and we are planning to test them with IFU observations from VIRUS-P at McDonald Observatory and GMOS at Gemini North.  Papers coming soon!

  Caption: Visualizing how LSST will point over 10 years. In this particular simulation, the telescope tended to get stuck observing things at high airmass in the west. We'll fix that before the survey starts.

    I've been working with the OpSim group to help analyze how well simulated LSST surveys perform.  A typical 10-year LSST survey includes 2.5 million visits.  Contribute your own survey metrics [on github](https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib)

    I was inspired by a recent paper on hiring networks in various academic departments, and figured it would be really easy to replicate for astronomy.  It would also be interesting to track how long careers are based on publication histories.

    The sheer absurdity of emoji amuses me.  I couldn't find a decent English 2 emoji translator, so I wrote my own.  It's very simple now, but with a tiny bit of training I think it could be pretty cool.

    Calibrating the LSST photometric system will be hard because of the giant scale of the problem. I've done some work figuring out how we could solve the large uber-cal matrix in parallel.
