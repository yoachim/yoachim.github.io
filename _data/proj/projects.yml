     Working with collaborators in Computer Science and Operations Research, I developed a new telescope 
     scheduling framework capable of intelligently observing 2 million exposures over a 10-year survey.

    I've been working on a project to study Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies.  
    These are bizarre systems that look like normal spirals, but are actually an order of magnitude larger in diameter.  
    There have been some creative formation theories proposed for these,

    Science funding agencies send out numerous surveys to track the state of the science job market. Given such surveys can have low response rates and biases, 
    I realized the large ADS database which tracks virtually all astronomy publications would be a better way to measure science career lifetimes.
