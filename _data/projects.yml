    I was inspired by a recent paper on hiring networks in various academic departments, and figured it would be really easy to replicate for astronomy.

    The sheer absurdity of emoji amuses me.  I couldn't find a decent english 2 emoji translator, so I wrote my own.  It's very simple now, but with a tiny bit of training I think it could be pretty cool.
