   I'm working on making a model for the background sky brightness on Cerro Pachon. This model will be used to help optimize the LSST scheduler.

    I've been working on a project to study Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies.  These are bizarre systems that look like normal spirals, but are actually an order of magnitude larger in diameter.  There have been some creative formation theories proposed for these, and we are planning to test them with IFU observations from VIRUS-P at McDonald Observaotory and GMOS at Gemini North.

    I was inspired by a recent paper on hiring networks in various academic departments, and figured it would be really easy to replicate for astronomy.

    The sheer absurdity of emoji amuses me.  I couldn't find a decent english 2 emoji translator, so I wrote my own.  It's very simple now, but with a tiny bit of training I think it could be pretty cool.
