This paper is the worst. Just the absolute worst. Like, I get that statistics can be hard, but this is written by medical school instructors!

I like this paper though, turns out booster seats, car seats, and seat belts are all about the same effectiveness. Juts strap kids down some way, it doesn't really matter. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180105124030.htm
