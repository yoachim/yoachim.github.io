<p>Looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rooney">Mickey Rooney died</a>, marking yet another victim of the <a title="The Curse of the Simpsons!" href="http://pyoachim.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/the-curse-of-the-simpsons/">Curse of the Simpsons</a>. He was a guest star in one of my all-time favorite episodes, Radioactive Man the Movie ("The goggles, they do nothing!").</p>
<p>I also see that over at the new fivethirtyeight site, Ben Morris did a very similar analysis to see if <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/are-pro-wrestlers-dying-at-an-unusual-rate/">professional wrestlers die early</a>. Unlike being a guest on the Simpsons, which correlates with an additional 3 years of longevity, being a pro wrestler seems to be very bad for your health.</p>
<p>One good point on Ben's analysis is that he used different actuarial tables for different years (to account for improving health technology), while I only used a recent one. I don't think this would change the Curse of the Simpsons much, and if it did it would be in the direction of making the anti-curse even stronger.</p>
