I've been reading comic strips for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I had every Calvin and Hobbes book and every Far Side.  These days I read plenty of web comics.  I recently discovered [MRA Dilbert](http://mradilbert.tumblr.com/), where the words on Dilbert comics are replaced by the bizarre blog rantings of Scott Adams.  This made me realize what (for me) makes a comic strip great, the art has to be part of the joke. For many Dilbert strips, the art adds nothing--the joke would work just as well as an all-text tweet. 

But look at this classic Calvin, it isn't funny at all without the art!

It just seems odd to write a comic that doesn't utilize the whole medium. It's like reading text off a PowerPoint slide. 

Anyway, here's my favorite example of a text joke that's kinda funny that becomes hilarious with the right art.
