I figured it would be fun to move my wordpress blog over to github.  Just means learing a little Ruby, Jekyll, CSS, and Markdown.

Luckily, I found a [nice post on migrating from wordpress](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/), and got [Poole the Jekyll Butler](http://getpoole.com/). 

Now to just spruce up the layout a bit, add a few more pages, fix the posts that got a little scrammbled, plug in some commenting system, sign up for google analytics, and update the default favicon.ico. Good times.
