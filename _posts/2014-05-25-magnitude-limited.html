<p>This post on <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">Survivor Bias</a> is amazing. Go read it! Now!</p>
<blockquote><p>One story in particular was nearly lost forever. In it, a brilliant statistician named Abraham Wald saved countless lives by preventing a group of military commanders from committing a common human error, a mistake that you probably make every single day.</p></blockquote>
<p>That might not be technically true. In fact, it's probably wrong. McRaney describes how Wald deduced the most important places to armor airplane bombers (you know, like the cockpit and fuel tanks, and really, that's what passes for an amazing insight, ok, whatever). My point is that he didn't save "countless lives", rather, he saved the lives of<em> countless bomber flight crews</em>. And since more of those bombers and crews made it back to base, more people were available to head back out on the next mission. And drop more bombs. That killed more people. It's easy to get lost in the fun of the math, but when you're working for the military, you rarely end up saving countless lives.</p>
<p>Lots of brilliant things have been written about WWII bombing runs. I'm not sure I have the fortitude to make it through Catch-22 and Slaughterhouse 5 again though. Maybe a little Howard Zinn.</p>
