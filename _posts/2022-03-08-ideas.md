Random ideas that I don't have time to follow up on

* I should write a twitter bot that finds and retweets jokes that are variations of "teach a man to fish...". It would be a good ML natural language kind of project

* I should write a twitter bot that finds and retweets trolly problem memes. It would be a fun ML vision project

* I should scrape twitter for folks posting wordle scores and see what fraction of folks are playing "wrong", ie, playing as if they are in hard-mode, but not actually in hard-mode. It's been eye-opening to see how many folks will lock in their correct letters even if it would clearly be better to eliminate many potential letters in a turn.
