One of my favorite ways to play Jeopardy is to try and guess what some of the answers will be based only on the catagory. For example, if the catagory is "Bond Films", I might guess Goldeneye, Live and Let Die, and Sean Connery as answers I expect to show up at some point. I want an app that lets me guess answers ahead of time and gives huge bonus points if I manage to hit one. Even bigger bonus if it's a daily double. And if you guess the final jeopardy answer from the topic alone you win the game.
