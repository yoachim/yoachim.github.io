<p>Fascinating plot on Nepotism over at <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nepotism-chart-2013-8">Business Insider</a>.</p>

<p>So it looks like wealthy people in Canada and Denmark are big on nepotism. That's not actually that surprising, what I'm curious about is the slight upturn on the left side of the plot. Why do sons of poor fathers work for the same employer more often than average?</p>
