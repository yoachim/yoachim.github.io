<p>The coffee shop in my building has a poster of this great Venn Diagram:</p>
<p><a href="https://pyoachim.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/coffee-venn-diagram.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" src="/assets/coffee-venn-diagram.jpg" alt="coffee-venn-diagram" width="508" height="558" /></a></p>
<p>But I'm not a coffee drinker. I'm more of a booze drinker. So I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://pyoachim.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cock_venn-008.png"><img class="size-full" src="/assets/cock_venn-008.png" alt="" width="599" height="448" /></a></p>
<p>I think I had a good idea, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired. A big part of the problem is that I don't have a copy of Illustrator. Or artistic skill. Or even the ability to avoid white text on a white background apparently. So let me throw this out to all the graphic designers and data visualizers out there. If anyone can make a pretty version, I'd love to see it! An additional 100 internets if you can do it with all circles.</p>
