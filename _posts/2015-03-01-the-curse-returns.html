<p>The Curse of the Simpsons has struck again with Leonard Nimoy (Seasons 4 and 8) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/arts/television/leonard-nimoy-spock-of-star-trek-dies-at-83.html">dying at age 83</a>. Given that he was born in 1931 and appeared in season 4, I calculate there was a 57% chance of him dying before now. So, like many of the other guest stars, he managed to outlive the standard life expectancy.</p>
