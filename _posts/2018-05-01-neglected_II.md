More things I'd like to play with, but haven't had time:

* Another cool dataset with birth records, implying that there is a ["human mating season"](http://blog.visme.co/most-common-birthday/?utm_content=buffer7e403&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). It would be fun to slice by age and see if this is for everyone, or just some subset of people. I'm guessing it could be just when people are inside more, like cold/flu season.
* My kids have forced me to play a millon hands of UNO. It would be good to check if there are actually any winning strategies for the game. Is it better to play reverses and draw 2/4 cards early or late, etc? It's not always obvious, but a Monte Carlo could show some interesting results (or the null result that there's no good strategy to be had).
* I want to make a vizulization of Disney/Pixar protagonist family mortality. It's long been known that Disney moms are at a huge risk of dying, but now we're seeing grandmothers and even great grandmothers dying (thanks Coco)
* I'm convinced the reason the original Star Wars movies and The Force Awakens were so good is that the main characters spent a large amount of time on screen together. I'd like to compare to the amount of time the main characters are together in The Last Jedi.
